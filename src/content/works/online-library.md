### My Thesis Project

> _Aplikasi Online Library merupakan sebuah aplikasi web yang digunakan untuk memfasilitasi akses ke koleksi sebuah perpustakaan yang telah terintegrasi secara daring. Koleksi yang dapat diakses baik koleksi digital seperti e-book dan audiobook, maupun katalog koleksi buku fisik di gedung perpustakaan._ \- An excerpt from my thesis

I majored in Computer Science at Binus University. For my thesis project, I worked as a group with two other friends. I developed the idea of an online library website, through looking at various other online library services such as Libby, Indonesia National Library's iPusnas and Binus' own online library.

I designed and coded the frontend part of the project while my other teammates worked the backend and the thesis document. I used **Vue.js** as my framework of choice with **Vuetify** for components.
I also integrated Progressive Web Application (PWA) technology with service workers so the website is installable and is able to receive notifications. Google's Firebase helped this project with it's cloud storage and push notification services.

Overall, I am proud of our thesis project and I learned a lot while working on it.

_I originally had the repository and deployed the finished web application at Heroku, but to the changes in free tier of the service, I made the decision to take it down. I will deploy it to another service in the future._

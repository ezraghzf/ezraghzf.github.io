Artlinks is a startup project aiming to create a platform for artists to share their work. I created the frontend web pages based on client's design with adjustments from my input. I applied Vue.js and created many components such as comments system and multiple image upload and cropping. I also consulted with the backend developers to create APIs and data schema together because the small scale of the team.

I worked on it remotely for the most part due to COVID-19 pandemic started a few months after the start of the project. I worked on it with my client and coworkers onsite beforehand.

_Unfortunately, the project got halted indefinitely in due to the effects COVID-19._

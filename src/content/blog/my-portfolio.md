I watch [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship) videos on YouTube a lot. Not only am I able to discover new technologies, I'm also able to learn them if it interests me. [Astro](https://astro.build/) caught my interest because not only because it has great performance, I'm also able to still use my other frameworks that I already learned like Vue if I want to.

While writing this, I am still a fresh graduate looking for work, so I figured I'm going to develop my own portfolio website to showcase the few works that I did. Astro is my framework of choice combined with Tailwind and DaisyUI for styling. I need to build a simple portfoilio quickly while still being able to showcase my skills. So I based this portfolio from [Manuel Ernesto's template](https://github.com/manuelernestog/astro-modern-personal-website) with modifications.

Overall, I enjoyed developing using Astro. Combined with my growing knowledge in using markdown syntax using [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) - a FOSS markdown editor to take notes and me currently learning React, it just adds more to the developer experience. Because of that, I was able to pick this framework up in a weekend while building this portfolio website.

In the future, I would love to rewrite this website from scratch, and utilizing fancy CSS features like animations and possibly using 3D animations library such as [three.js](https://threejs.org/).
